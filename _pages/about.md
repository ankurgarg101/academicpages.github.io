Hi! I am Ankur Garg and I am currently a Masters student in the Computer Science department at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML) and deep learning. I am especially interested in building semi-supervised and unsupervised learning models to aid situations where supervision is complex or richly annotated data is unavailable or costly to obtain for complex NLP tasks.

Prior to joining UT, I completed my B. Tech in Computer Science & Engg. from [Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) in 2016. I also spent a couple of years at the [BigData Experience Lab, Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/about-the-labs/bigdata-experience-lab/) as a research fellow working on developing ML models for various products spanning Adobe's Digital Marketing and Document Cloud business.

I am interning at Google Inc. in Sunnyvale, CA over the summer and actively looking for full-time opportunities for 2020.
