Hi Everyone! My name is Ankur Garg and I am a Masters student at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests include natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). I am especially interested in building semi-supervised and unsupervised learning models to aid situations where supervision is complex or richly annotated data is unavailable or costly to obtain.

I completed my B. Tech in Computer Science & Engg. from [Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) in 2016. Before joining UT, I spent a couple of years at the [BigData Experience Lab, Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/about-the-labs/bigdata-experience-lab/) as a research fellow.

I was born and raised in the city of [Chandigarh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh). It is nicknamed as the 'City Beautiful' for its cleanliness and city planning.
